# FlightTracker5
I was getting an error related to my Flightscontroller. The issue was as followed:

![Error code](https://github.com/agault/FlightTracker5/blob/master/Newerror.PNG)
My actionable intentions are as followed:
1.Switch to the 5101 way of connecting. I think will work.
2.Build the List(), and view
3.finish the flight controller
4.move onto as many views and crud functions as possible.
